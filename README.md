## Context
The first three editions of BUCSS took place in Bucharest (Romania) (see e.g. [here](https://icub.unibuc.ro/events/bucss2019/) for 2019). 
This 4th edition took place from 26 to 29 September 2022 at Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany), and aimed at 1) providing a general introduction to different facets of urban climatology with a special focus on urban climate informatics, 2) providing structured information and skill-building capabilities related to urban climate monitoring, remote sensing and modelling, and 3) strengthening an active pool of young scientists to tackle the major urban sustainability challenges of future generations.

## Course materials
The programme consists out of state-of-the-art lectures and hands-on tutorials on remote sensing in urban areas, crowdsourcing and urban climate modelling. All of these teaching resources are available here:

### Hands-on sessions
- - -

During the school, all notebooks were executed in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), reading and writing information from a dedicated Google Drive. So in case you are using these notebooks outside this environment, you probably have to take care of your own python environment and directory definitions. 

<br>

#### _Process ESA CCI LST/SUHI data_


![SUHII_ENLIGHT_hysteresis.png](img/SUHII_ENLIGHT_hysteresis.png)


This hands-on is composed out of two parts:

1. Process MODIS LST data and calculate zonal statistics ([Python notebook](notebooks/LST_Exercise_partA.ipynb))
2. Open the SUHI database for Mexico, developed in the [ENLIGHT project](https://www.climate.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/research/projects/enlight/), and process it in a number of ways, leading to the SUHII seasonal hysteresis as published in [Sismanidis et al. 2022](http://doi.org/10.3390/rs14102318) ([Python notebook](notebooks/LST_Exercise_partB.ipynb)).

These hands-ons require the following files available under `data/LST/`:

* `ESACCI-LST-MODIST-RUBMEX-2018-D.nc`: MODIS LST data
* `mexico_cities.tif`: raster layer with urban boundaries
* `SUHI_DB-MOD11A1.061-v1.0.1.db`: excerpt of SUHI database developed in the [ENLIGHT project](https://www.climate.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/research/projects/enlight/)
* `SUHII_monthly_means.db`: excerpt of SUHI database developed in the [ENLIGHT project](https://www.climate.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/research/projects/enlight/)

<br>

#### _Quality control CWS data with CrowdQC+_

![dTa_CrowdQCplus.png](img/dTa_CrowdQCplus.png)

Goal of this workshop is to apply to learn how to apply the quality-control package [CrowdQC+](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.720747) on an excerpt of the global CWS database compiled in the [ENLIGHT project](https://www.climate.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/research/projects/enlight/).

Via this [Python notebook](notebooks/crowdqcplus_application.ipynb) you learn how to:

- use R in a Python environment
- get hands-on experience with real crowdsourced CWS data
- investigate issues with such data
- use CrowdQC+ to quality-control such data
- do some first analyses with the quality-controlled data

This hands-on requires the `cws_data_cqcp_hands_on.csv` file available under `data/CWS/`

#### _Greenest German city in Google Earth Engine_

![gee_greenest_cities.png](img/gee_greenest_cities.png)

In [this interactive newspaper article](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/gruenste-staedte-deutschlands/), published in the Berliner Morgenpost May 10 2016, the authors used the Landsat archive in Google Earth Engine to estimate the "greenest" large (>100 000 inhabitants) city in Germany.   

The goal of this hands-on is the replicate this work, using Sentinel-2 information in stead. The procedure consist out of three steps:

1. Create a database with relevant cities ([Python notebook](notebooks/GEE_prep_city_data.ipynb))
2. Add greennees to this database ([GEE javascript](notebooks/greenest_city_germany.js))
3. Display the results ([Python notebook](notebooks/GEE_plot_city_data.ipynb))

This hands-on requires the `05-staedte.xlsx` and `gadm41_DEU_4.json` files available under `data/GEE/`

#### _WRF evaluation and roottop mitigation strategies_

![WRF_Netatmo_evaluation.png](img/WRF_Netatmo_evaluation.png)

For this hands-one, 6 WRF simulations are pre-computed, covering the Ruhr-Area (Germany) and heatwave period between 20 - 28 July 2019. Further details on the model's configuration and simulation details are provided in the [WRF hands-on slides](https://github.com/RUBclim/BUCSS22/blob/main/lectures/Demuzere_Zonato_WRF-HandsOn.pdf).

Two notebooks are developed to complete this exercise:
- [WRF_functions.ipynb](notebooks/WRF_functions.ipynb): a notebook that contains a set of pre-scripted functions to read, manipulate and evalute all WRF input and output, the latter in combination with CWS observations (no changes needed in this one).
- [WRF_functions.ipynb](notebooks/WRF_functions.ipynb): a notebook to read, manipulate and evalute all WRF input and output, the latter in combination with CWS observations. Also assesses the impact of the rooftop mitigation strategy simulations.

These hands-ons require a bunch of files available under

* `data/WRF_CWS/`:
  * `netatmo_heatwave_2019_bucss.csv`: quality-controlled timeseries of 5000+ CWS stations in the Ruhr-area, for the period 21-28 July 2019.
  * `netatmo_heatwave_2019_bucss_metadata.csv`: metadata for all above-mentioned CWS stations

* `data/WRF/`:
  * `INPUT/`: the required geo_em*.nc files to run the various WRF simulations. Note that:
    * the Local Climate Zone map for the Ruhr area was extracted from the global map of Local Climate Zones [(Demuzere et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-3835-2022). 
    * the [W2W package](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04432) was used to insert the LCZ-based urban description.

  * `OUTPUT/`: output files for all WRF simulations. 

Please see  [WRF hands-on slides](https://github.com/RUBclim/BUCSS22/blob/main/lectures/Demuzere_Zonato_WRF-HandsOn.pdf) for further details.
