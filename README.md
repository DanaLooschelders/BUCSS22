# BUCSS22
Course materials from the Bochum Urban Climate Summer School (Germany, 2022)

## Context
The first three editions of BUCSS took place in Bucharest (Romania) (see e.g. [here](https://icub.unibuc.ro/events/bucss2019/) for 2019). 
This 4th edition took place from 26 to 29 September 2022 at Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany), and aimed at 1) providing a general introduction to different facets of urban climatology with a special focus on urban climate informatics, 2) providing structured information and skill-building capabilities related to urban climate monitoring, remote sensing and modelling, and 3) strengthening an active pool of young scientists to tackle the major urban sustainability challenges of future generations.
